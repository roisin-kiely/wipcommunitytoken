# WIP Community Token

This project is a decentralized platform for showcasing AI-generated art within a community. It uses the **WIP token** built on the Ethereum blockchain to enable users to engage, tip, and reward each other. Through blockchain technology, it creates a fair, transparent, and community-driven environment where users can participate in the art community by interacting with others using WIP tokens.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build a decentralized application (dApp) that enables community engagement using blockchain. Users can showcase their art, interact with others, and participate in tipping or receiving tips using the WIP token. The platform allows users to unlock specific permissions based on their WIP token balance, such as the ability to post and comment.

## Key Features

- **WIP Token**: The ERC-20 token used for tipping and rewarding members in the community.
- **Posting and Commenting Rights**: Users can post or comment depending on their WIP token balance.
- **Minting**: The owner can mint new WIP tokens and distribute them to members.
- **Thresholds for Engagement**: Users must meet a certain WIP balance to unlock posting and commenting privileges.
- **Community Engagement**: The platform encourages members to tip and reward one another using WIP tokens.

## Why Blockchain?

Building this platform on the Ethereum blockchain enables decentralization and transparency. The use of the WIP token allows for community-driven engagement and rewards, ensuring fair interactions without reliance on centralized systems. Blockchain ensures that user interactions are secure, verifiable, and governed by smart contracts, creating a trustless environment.

## How It Works

- **Wallet Connection**: Users connect their Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the platform.
- **Token Balance**: Users can send and receive WIP tokens to engage with other community members.
- **Posting & Commenting**: Users with enough WIP tokens can unlock the ability to post and comment within the platform.
- **Minting & Rewards**: The owner can mint and distribute WIP tokens to incentivize engagement and growth.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: For the smart contract governing the WIP token and community interaction.
- **Ethereum**: The blockchain used for decentralized account management and transactions.
- **Alchemy**: Used for connecting to the Sepolia testnet for contract deployment.
- **Hardhat**: For smart contract deployment and testing.
- **Etherscan**: For contract verification and monitoring.
- **Solidity Compare**: Used for contract comparison and review.
- **Visual Studio Code**: The development environment used for writing code.
- **Remix IDE**: Used for testing and deploying Solidity contracts.
- **Next.js**: Framework for building the frontend of the platform.
